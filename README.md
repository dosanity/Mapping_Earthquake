# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. We used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON earthquake data linked to the USGS website. To display our data, we used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
